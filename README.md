# Pixels Animation with JavaScript

This Javascript Project creates a Particles Animation. 

## General Ideias behind the Project

*   Get an Image's pixels data.
*   Create a Particles System.
*   Animate the Particles with an artificial "Physical System", so that Particles velocity, size, and other parameters depends on Image properties such as Color and Brightness.
